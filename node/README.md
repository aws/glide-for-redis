This package contains an internal package under the folder `rust-client`, which is just the Rust library and its auto-generated TS code. The external package, in this folder, contains all wrapping TS code and tests.

### First time install
Homebrew is the easiest way to install node, but you can choose any way you want to install it.
Npm should come as part as node.
Use npm to install yarn globaly - `npm install -g yarn` 
run `yarn run initial-build`.

### Build

Run `yarn run build-internal` to build the internal package and generates TS code. `yarn run build-external` builds the external package without rebuilding the internal package.
Run `npm run build` runs a full build.

### Testing

Run `yarn test` after building.
