This package contains an internal package under the folder `rust-client`, which is just the Rust library and its auto-generated TS code. The external package, in this folder, contains all wrapping TS code and tests.

### First time install

Homebrew is the easiest way to install node, but you can choose any way you want to install it.
Npm should come as part as node. IMPORTANT - right now we support only npm major version 8.
The default install will be of version 9, so you'll need to downgrade - run `npm i -g npm@8`.

### Build

Run `npm run build-internal` to build the internal package and generates TS code. `npm run build-external` builds the external package without rebuilding the internal package. Run `npm run build-protobuf` to generate node's protobuf files.
Run `npm run build` runs a full build.

### Testing

Run `npm test` after building.

### [Optional] Manually compile protobuf files 

1. Run `npm install protobufjs-cli` to install the JS protobuf command line utility
2. Generate static JS code `pbjs -t static-module -o ProtobufMessage.js ~/babushka/babushka-core/src/protobuf/pb_message.proto`
3. Generates TS definitions from the compiled JS file `pbts -o ProtobufMessage.d.ts ProtobufMessage.js`
4. Due to a bug in the autogenerated files (see https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/issues/1063), manually replace `return this.encode(message, writer).ldelim();` to `return this.encode(message, writer && writer.len ? writer.fork() : writer).ldelim();` in the encodeDelimited functions of Request and Response under babushka/node/src/ProtobufMessage.js.
