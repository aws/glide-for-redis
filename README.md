### benchmarks:
If while running benchmarks you're redis-server killed every time the program run the 4000 data-size benchmark it might be because you don't have enough available storage on your machine.
For solving this issue, you have two option -
1. Allocate more storage to your'e machine. for me the case was allocating from 500 gb to 1000 gb.
2. Go to benchmarks/install_and_test.sh and change the "dataSize="100 4000"" to data-size that your machine can handle. try for example dataSize="100 1000".
